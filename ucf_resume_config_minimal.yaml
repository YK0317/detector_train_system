# ============================================================================
# FIELDS NOT INCLUDED (Restored from checkpoint or ignored in resume training)
# ============================================================================
# 
# ‚ùå NOT USED IN RESUME - These are restored from checkpoint:
# - optimizer: "adam"                 # Restored from checkpoint
# - scheduler: "cosine"               # Restored from checkpoint  
# - scheduler_params                  # Restored from checkpoint
# - weight_decay: 0.0001             # Restored from checkpoint
# - best_val_accuracy                # Restored from checkpoint
# - training_losses                  # Restored from checkpoint
# - validation_accuracies            # Restored from checkpoint
# - current_epoch                    # Restored from checkpoint
#
# ‚ùå NOT USED IN RESUME - These are typically ignored:
# - model.pretrained: false          # Ignored (loading from checkpoint)
# - model.architecture               # Must match, but not actively used
# - model.adapter                    # Auto-detected from model
# - data.augmentation                # Can be included but often ignored
# - data.max_samples                 # Can be used if specified
# - training.mixed_precision         # Usually follows original training
# - training.gradient_clipping       # Usually follows original training
#
# üí° OPTIONAL FIELDS (Can be included if you want to override defaults):
# - data.augmentation: {...}         # If you want different augmentation
# - training.mixed_precision: true   # If you want to change precision
# - training.gradient_clipping: 1.0  # If you want different clipping
